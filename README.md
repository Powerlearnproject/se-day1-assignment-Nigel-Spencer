Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

a) Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software.

b) Software engineering provides maintainable, scalable, and efficient software systems which are the foundations of the mordern technological industry. These systems could mean the increased efficiency of integral institutions like the medical industry, education, finance, and communication.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

a) The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
b) The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
c) The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

a) Planning - Gathering requirements for the customer and documenting them
b) Design - Creating a blueprint for the software
c) Testing - Testing the software to ensure it functions properly and meets requirements
d) Deployment - Moving the software from the testing environment to an operating environment
e) Maintenance - Monitoring the software for issues that may arise once in production


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

a)  Waterfall is sequential in approach with distinct phases for example requirements, design, implementation, which flow downwards like a waterfall. Agile is iterative and incremental in approach and focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

b) Waterfall would be appropriate for solo projects where you would need to create a map with precise steps in order to be able to keep on track. Agile is appropriate for teamwork because certain smaller tasks can be assigned to different parts of the team.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

a) A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b) A quallity assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c) A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

a) Integrated Development Environments enhance productivity and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities. e.g. Visual Studio

b) Version Control Systems are important when tracking changes and updates to code, fostering collaboration, and improving project management by providing a history of all previous modifications to the code. e.g. Github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a) Challenges:
1. Changing requirements
2. Tight deadlines
3. Technical debt

b) Strategies for Overcoming Challenges:
1. Effective communication
2. Agile methodologies
3. Prioritization of tasks
4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

a) Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software
b) Integration Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
c) System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole
d) Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

a) Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
b) Prompt engineering helps avoid vague questions and confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

a) Different prompts:
1. This is a vague prompt: Tell me about Kenya
2. This is a specific prompt: Tell me about the country of Kenya; Its location, its history, its economic status, its current government, and its likely future.

b) The second prompt is more effective than the first because it asks for specifics rather than letting the AI decide what it thinks is useful information. A user now has a more complete overview of the country of Kenya which they may use to communicate in a better way to others.
